# Date Night
![Joseph Daniele, Sr bought his 1929 Model A in 1940 and drove it on special occasions.  Namely to take his wife, Ann, on a weekly date to the ice cream shop nearly 10 miles on the other side of town.   Not long ago Ann was diagnosed with dementia and needed to live in a nursing home.   Without fail, Joe took out the old Model A and traveled to the north end to pick up his wife and take her out to the ice cream shop.  He died recently and his daughter put the car up for sale.  The front seat has an ice cream stain.  ](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/c227ea19-e1c7-49af-bc08-9d7c7024cef8.jpg)
